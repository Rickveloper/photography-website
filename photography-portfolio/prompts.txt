JSON-LD for Person + ImageGallery + BlogPosting.

Extras:

Subtle film-grain overlay in hero (disabled if prefers-reduced-motion).

Service worker for offline viewing of images/blog.

Blog posts should be easy to add manually by dropping new HTML/Markdown files into a /blog/ folder.

Deliverables:
Produce production-ready index.html, styles.css, app.js, blog.html + single-post template, manifest.webmanifest, and service worker. Include placeholder photos in /assets/.

Tighten spacing: reduce section padding by 12%, increase card gutter to 1.2rem, and cap content width at 1120px
Make the header logo a simple SVG wordmark; replace text with SVG and ensure accessible name.
Add subtle film-grain overlay to hero via CSS pseudo-element; disable it for prefers-reduced-motion
Implement EXIF strip with icons and monospaced numbers; ensure it collapses on small screens.
Add RSS feed XML for ‘Latest Shoots’ using static examples; link in footer.
